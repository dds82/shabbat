# shabbat
Virtual device driver to schedule shabbat/yom tov and change location mode automatically.  Provides options for Plag, constant time early shabbat (with configurable time), and Zman.

Also detects certain holidays which may need special treatment (e.g. lights turning off later).

Configuration options should be self-explanatory.
